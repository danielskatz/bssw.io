The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) is organizing a series of Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) sessions with the goal of bringing together the High Performance Computing community to discuss various scientific development efforts taking place within ECP as well as the overall domain.


The *Cultivating Software Sustainability, Productivity and Quality through BSSw.io* community Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) is being organized by the Exascale Computing Project (ECP). In this BOF session, the organizers and the community will share experiences on using and contributing to BSSw.io.  An objective is open discussion to understand pressing needs, challenges, and potential roadblocks for software sustainability and productivity, in order to determine priorities for future directions in site content, usage, and contributions.  The long-term vision for BSSw is to serve as an international community-driven and community-managed resource, with content and editorial processes provided by volunteers. We welcome everyone to participate.
