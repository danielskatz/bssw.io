Effective management of [*technical debt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) is a significant challenge in any software product.
The concept of *debt* in a software product is the idea that certain *necessary* design and coding work is delayed but promised later in order to deliver something sooner.
This idea of *promising* to do tomorrow what you probably should have done today is like a *debt* to be paid off.

Software teams are almost always confronted with chosing between doing work the best way or the doing it the fastest.
A problem with best way is that it costs more to develop and takes longer to implement relative to the fastest.
On the other hand, the best way also usually preserves [non-functional requirements (NFRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes) and keeps [software entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy) low.
The fastest way usually neglects entirely one or more NFRs and increases software entropy.
This can make changing or extending the software later more costlier than it otherwise would have been which represents a kind of *interest* on technical debt.

The article, [Technical Debt: The Ultimate Guide](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/technical-debt-explained-the-complete-guide-to-understanding-and-dealing-with-technical-debt), provides an overview of these concepts and offers some best practices to address them.
