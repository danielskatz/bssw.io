# How Technical Debt and Interest can Sink a Software Project
<!--deck text start-->
A technical debt is like a [promissory note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promissory_note) to engage in coding work tomorrow that should have been done but wasn't to deliver something today.

Effective management of [*technical debt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) is a significant challenge in any software product.
The concept of *debt* in a software product is the idea that certain *necessary* design and coding work is delayed but promised later in order to deliver something sooner.

Software teams are almost always confronted with chosing between doing work the best way or the doing it the fastest.
A problem with best way is that it costs more to develop and takes longer to implement relative to the fastest.
On the other hand, the best way also usually preserves [non-functional requirements (NFRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes) and keeps [software entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy) low.
The fastest way usually neglects or underminds entirely one or more NFRs and increases software entropy.

This idea of *promising* to do tomorrow what you should have done today is like creating a *debt* to be paid off.
Externally, the software may continue to meet user's expectations.
Internally, however, it gets messier.
That mess makes future coding work harder, costlier and is analgous to *interest* to be paid on the debt.

The article, [Technical Debt: The Ultimate Guide](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/technical-debt-explained-the-complete-guide-to-understanding-and-dealing-with-technical-debt), provides an overview of these concepts and offers some best practices to address them.
